=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Warnings::Version '5.6';
      # All warnings that exist on both perl 5.6 and your running version of
      # perl will be enabled.
      #   For example, on perl 5.8 this will mean all 5.8 warnings except
      #   'layer' and 'threads' warnings.

  use Warnings::Version '5.6.2';
      # Same thing; Warnings::Version ignores the .2 at the end.

  use Warnings::Version '5.20';
      # All warnings that exist on both perl 5.20 and your running version of
      # perl will be enabled.
      #   For example, on perl 5.8 this will mean all 5.8 warnings except 'y2k'
      #   warnings.

  use Warnings::Version 'all';
      # This special warning category gives you only the warnings that are on
      # _all_ perls that ship with the warnings pragma.

  use Warnings::Version 'all';
  no warnings 'deprecated';      # You can disable specific warnings as usual

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Since newer versions of perl may add new warning categories, it can be annoying
getting spurious warnings for code that used to work completely fine on a
previous version of perl. This module only loads the warning categories that
exist on both the perl you're running with, as well as the perl you wrote the
module for. It is meant for module authors or people running code in
production, who don't want to get tonnes of emails and bugreports when someone
upgrades their perl version and your code starts emitting warnings. Of course
you should still keep up to date with deprecations and perl's experiments so
your code doesn't break when there's been actual changes in how things work,
but with this module, at least your I<users> don't need to worry about that
too.
